        <h3> If you're thinking of getting your first tattoo, you probably have a lot of questions.
            <br> Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about getting a tattoo.
        </h3>

        <h2>
            Are Tattoos Safe?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As long as you go to a reputable artist that is following all recommended safety precautions, getting a tattoo is perfectly safe. Make sure you're fully honest about any medical conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>
            WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING YOUR FIRST TATTOO?
        </h2>
        <p>
            You should have a good idea of what you want and where you want it. 
            Do some research. Especially if you are having the artist draw a custom design. 
            Be sure of what you want before you approach your artist to draw your custom piece.

        <h2>
            Does It Hurt?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Pain is really relative. Everyone has a different tolerance for pain. 
            We're not going to kid you, thoughâ€”it does hurt. Just not that much. Some have compared it to a "hot scratching feeling." 
            But, people would not be returning again and again for tattoo after tattoo if it hurt that bad. Most of us are not into pain, 
            but the beauty of the tattoo and the pride associated with wearing it far outweighs a little pin-stick here and there.
            What about using some kind of numbing cream? These kinds of products are really not recommended.

        <h2>
            Is It OK to Get a Tattoo if I'm Sick?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Getting a tattoo when your immune system isn't at 100% isn't a good idea. 
            You're going to need your strength and your white blood cells to heal your tattoo, 
            something your body won't be able to do if it's already doing battle against virus and bacteria. 
            Not to mention the fact that it's very inconsiderate to bring your illness into the tattoo studio and risk passing the germs onto others, 
            particularly your artist. If you have an appointment, call and reschedule for when you're feeling well again.
